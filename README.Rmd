```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
df <- read_csv('training_plan.csv')

today <- today()

todays.plan <- df %>% 
  filter(
    date == today + 3
  )
```


Today is `r format(today,'%A, %d %B, %Y')`, and we are in week `r todays.plan$plan_week` of the `r todays.plan$plan` plan. 
Therefore the training category of the day is **`r todays.plan$activity_category`**.
