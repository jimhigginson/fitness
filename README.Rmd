```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
df <- read_csv('training_plan.csv')

today <- today()

todays.plan <- df %>% 
  filter(
    date == today + 3
  )

upcoming.plan <- df
```


Today is `r format(today,'%A, %d %B, %Y')`, and we are in week **`r todays.plan$plan_week`** of the **`r todays.plan$plan`** plan. 

The training category of the day is **`r todays.plan$activity_category`**.

## Activity
Today's training activity is summarised in the table below.
```{r}
knitr::kable(todays.plan%>% 
  select(activity, sets, reps))
```
Once complete, remember to update the 'completed' status to TRUE. If skipped, put FALSE. 

But don't skip it!!
